/*This programming project is based on Programming Projects 7.8 and 5.7. Write
a program that outputs a histogram of grades for an assignment given to a class of
students. The program should input each studentâ€™s grade as an integer and store
the grade in a vector. Grades should be entered until the user enters -1 for a grade.
The program should then scan through the vector and compute the histogram. In
computing the histogram, the minimum value of a grade is 0, but your program
should determine the maximum value entered by the user. Use a dynamic array to
store the histogram. Output the histogram to the console.*/
